# Sur-Ron Swingarm

Crazy idea to 3D model a Sur-Ron compatible swingarm in OpenSCAD so that I can investigate a limited-unit production run of a stiffer and slightly longer swingarm.

My OpenSCAD-Fu is basic so if anyone sees this, please suggest good fixes :)

TL;DR I'm happy for you to use all or parts of this model, including to machine or otherwise build a physical version, as long as this is done in a non-commercial manner. 

You may use it to produce your own swingarm for personal use, as long as any design markings are left intact. If you modify or improve this model or components of, you must share your modifications publicly and attribute this repository as the original model.

If you want to use this model commercially, please contact me via Github. This is an early stage project for my own personal use so of course YMMV, I am not responsible for any injury or death you might achieve by building or using this model, and take no liability for any loss, damage or injury you might incur either during build or use of the models in this repository.
